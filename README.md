This is a bracelet planning software built in C using clay
This is my 3rd time attempting this project, and my first time using clay

how to build it?
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
takes a lil while, has to fetch and build raylib and stuff
it should be able to run anywhere (WIP)
then 
```
./bracelet_maker 
```
to run (in build dir)
